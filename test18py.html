Hiding implementaion from 
obstract class ->to enforce structure
ABC->abstract base class
from abc import Abc
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class ATM(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def withdraw-money(self,amount):
           pass

        @abstractmethod
        def withdraw-money(self,amount):
           pass

        def withdraw-money(self,amount):
           print("this is an atm")
atm1 = ATM()
print(atm1) -> throw error

obstract class->
which does not have complete  implementation becoz 
it has methods that also doesn't have implementations
therefore you cannot create an obj for abstract class
if any class inherit from abstract class then it should implement abstract class methods 

magic methods /dunder methods:- to use built-in methods of python to work it on our created class objects we use dunder methods
